# Election_Analysis2

## Overview of Election Audit:
We have been asked to read a csv file with election data from 3 counties in Colorado. We then are asked to format and save election results to file in summarizing the results of the election. Through the use of python 3 we are able to loop through the data in the csv file collecting voting data for our counties and candidates storing them in variables to be used when the time is right. We then recall the variables to add them to a formula that will determine the amount of votes for each candidate and the counties where they are voting from to summarize the election results data for display and saving to a file that can be distributed.
